# Use the Buy Button of Checkout Cielo 

Integration via Button is a method of buying used whenever there is no "shopping cart" in your store or when you want to associate a 
direct instant purchase to a product, as a promotion in the homepage and skipping the shopping cart step.

Integration via button can also be used to send an e-mail marketing, or a collection via email, ie, adding the button (HTML) for the 
product/service to be purchased/paid. Or whenever you want to provide a quick sale.

To use this feature, you must register the product you want to sell your information, and then simply copy the generated source code 
for this button. The inclusion of the products is done within the Backoffice, at Products menu/Register Product

## Button features:

*	Each generated button is only for a particular product.
*	The price of the product can not be changed in the Checkout screen
* It's not necessary develop a shopping cart
*	Registration of the product is required to create the button.

Each button has a unique code that only allows to buy that particular product in price and shipping registered. 
Therefore, a fraudster can not change any of this information at the time of submitting the purchase because the Cielo's Checkout 
will get all product data in the Backoffice of the register, and will be worth the registered data.

# Payment options

This section explains the payment's methods used by Cielo's Checkout, as these work and how these are controlled in the backoffice.

## Boleto

All boleto generated (issued) appears with the status of "PENDING" in the Order Report. Their exchange status will depend on manual 
actions of the retailer.

### POSSIBLE BOLETO STATUS

* *PENDING** - boleto issued by the transaction process. Status continues until manually changed by the retailers.
* **PAID OUT** - Status used when the "Conciliate" button is activated by the retailer.This status can be reverted to pending using 
the "Undo reconciliation" Button.
* **EXPIRED** - active status after 10 days of creation of the boleto, if this has not located reconciled during this period. 
Boletos with "EXPIRED" status can be reconciled.

### RECONCILING A BOLETO

It is up to the retailer to confirm the payment through a Conciliation Guide with her/his bank statement.

![reconciling a boleto](/images/checkout-cielo-conciliar-boleto.png)

To perform the Conciliation you should:

1.	Access the order report at the Backoffice;
2.	Filter orders by Payment Method "Boleto" and status "PENDING" and identify the boleto concerned by amount;
3.	Click on the sign + at the end of the line to access the page "Details";
4.	Click on the button "Confirm Payment" and inform the payment date, for your control in the future;

The request goes to PAID status. The Buyer will also see the request as PAID in the "Backoffice of the Purchaser"

### UNDOING THE RECONCILIATION (PAYMENT) OF A BOLETO.

If the conciliation has been done wrong, simply:

1.	Find the Order;
2.	Enter the details and click on "Undo Payment" button;
3.	The order will return to the status of "PENDING".

## EXPIRED BOLETOS:

for better control of the expired boletos. EXPIRED boletos can be reconciled.

![Boleto](/images/checkout-cielo-boleto.png)

<aside class="notice">Boleto validity - If the boleto expires on a non-working day, like Saturday, it will be valid until the 
next business day</aside>

### Data flow of Boleto

![Data flow of Boleto](/images/checkout-fluxo-boleto.png)

## Credit card

The Cielo's Checkout accepts major credit issuers in Brazil and in the world.They are: Visa, MasterCard, American Express (Amex), Link,
Diners, Discover, JCB and Aura.

### RECEIVING A CREDIT CARD SALE

Order by credit card will be included in [Backoffice Cielo Checkout](http://developercielo.github.io/Checkout-Backoffice/)t as 
"AUTHORIZED" or "not authorized", depending on the result of the authorization in Cielo. If you have any problem when processing 
this request (the consumer closed the screen, for example), it will include as **"NOT FINISHED"**.

## FRAUD ANALYSIS 

Orders **"AUTHORIZED"** will be sent online, that is, upon sale, to analyze the anti-fraud tool, when this development is properly 
standardized integration.The result of this analysis will be translated in the field **"AF indication"** in the Order Report for each 
order.

This analysis indicates a **"LOW RISK"** or "HIGH RISK" for the sale.This suggestion is what should guide the decision to confirm or 
cancel the sale. The analysis will be presented in "Order Details", as below:

![Fraud analysis](/images/checkout-cielo-analise-risco.png)

## Credit recurrence in Cielo Checkout

The Recurrence is an automated scheduling process of credit transactions, that is, a transaction that automatically repeats without
requiring the buyer to access transactional screen, according to the rules defined at the time of scheduling.

Recurring transactions are ideal for business models that involve the concept of signature or transactions that are repeated, 
but should not occupy the buyer's credit limit.

Difference between recurring transactions and installments:

* **Installments:** This is a transaction divided into "N" months.The integration amount of the transaction ranks independent buyer of
the initial installment credit limit (see example).The retailer receives the sales amount in installments and not run the risk of the 
installments be denied.
*	* **EX**: Sales of R $ 1,000.00 installments in 2 times.Although the buyer to pay only R $ 500.00 in the first installment, 
the amount of the consumed credit limit in January is full, R $ 1,000.00. If the card limit is less than R $ 1,000.00 the transaction 
will be denied
*	* **Recurring**: They are different transactions on the same card in previously scheduled times.The first transaction schedules the 
future sales from an interval X (see example). Each "X" intervals will charge your credit card. A sale can be divided into 
"N" Recurrences in order to not take the credit limit of a buyer (see example 02)
*	* **EX02**: Sales of R$ 1,000.00 on 01/15/2015, with a monthly recurrence and end date on 01/06/2015. Thereby, all transaction on
15/02 will be a new charge of R$ 1,000 in the buyer's card, repeating the process until 15/05, which is the last valid date before the
end date.
*	**EX03:** Sales of R$ 1,000 on 01/15/2015, with Monthly recurrence using two instalments.The store may have the intelligence to send 
the Checkout a transaction of $ 500.00 in January with monthly interval closing date in 15/02/2015.In this situation, the limit 
occupied at buyer's card will be R$ 500.00 initial invoice, avoiding the risk shown in Example 01

A recurrence transaction on the Cielo Checkout has two settings: "Interval" and "Closing Date".

•	**Interval** - repeating pattern and time interval between each transaction (monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, half yearly and annual)

•	* **Closing date** - Date of the recurrence process fails to occur.

The buyer's credit card data is stored securely within the Cielo's Checkout, allowing its reuse in a recurring transaction. This data is not accessed by the retailer.

The Recurrence transactions are available in the Backoffice as other sales in your store "ORDERS" tab.The first recurring transaction is a normal transaction, following the rules and preferences set by the retailer in the backoffice.Subsequent transactions are captured automatically.

## RECURRENCE BUTTON

One way to accomplish recurrence within the Checkout is to create a recurring button.Simply register the product, including a charge 
interval and a date for closing (optional), as shown below:

![Recurrence button](/images/checkout-botao-recorrencia.png)

<aside class="warning">If a button is used after the "End Date" registered, the transaction raises an error displaying "Oppss" in 
transactional screen. Data can be edited on the button of the editing screen in "Product Details"</aside>

### CANCELLATION OF CIELO CHECKOUT RECURRENCE

transaction (marked with the symbol "Applicant"), go into the details (the symbol "+")

![My sales](/images/checkout-minhas-vendas.png)
